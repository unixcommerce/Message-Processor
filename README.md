# Message Processor
A tool to help you compose emails more quickly

Message Processor, at this stage, is an addin for Microsoft Outlook 2019 that makes it very simple to populate the body of any new message in Outlook with the contents of text files ,randomly and non-repeating, after selecting a directory where those messages are located. This is part of an implementation of "cloud engine" from a few years ago. We have replaced it with desktop software.
