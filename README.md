# messageprocessor
A tool to help you compose emails more quickly

Message Processor, at this stage, is a addin for Microsoft Outlook 2020 that makes it very simple to populate the body of any new message in Outlook with the contents of text files ,randomly and non-repeating, after selecting a directory where those messages are located. This is part of an implementation of "cloud engine" from a few years ago. We have replaced it with desktop software.
